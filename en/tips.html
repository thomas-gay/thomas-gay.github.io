<div class="section"><p>I do not have time to call every recruiter who contacts me. I do not have the time to ask you for basic information you give me sparingly.<br /><br />MAKE ME WANT TO RE-CONTACT YOU !<br /><br />Here is my "list to Santa" of information which will GREATLY increase the chance I answer.<ol><li>The location, and the most precise possible. I am looking for full remote or north/norrh-west of Lyon (France).</li>
<li>The technical and functional environment. What programming language ? What OS ? What IDE ? etc. and <span title="Especially for C++. C++14 is a strict minimum.">what versions ?</span> On the functionnal side, what does the product do ? Who uses it ?</li>
<li>The remuneration, at large. That means the salary, of course, but also what's around it. And the "depends on the profile" are a big red flag for me. There are salary grids, the job has been budgetted, we all know there are numbers somewhere :)</li>
<li>The USEFULL perquisites. A babyfoot is grotesque. On the other hand, knowing how many screens I will have, if there are internal trainings, if we can be helped (financially or otherwise) to go to a conference abroad, etc. is a big plus.</li>
</ol>
Moreover, a mail with "when can we talk ?" rather than "are you interested ?" wends a bad singla and do not make us want to work with you. We do not like to be forced.</p>
